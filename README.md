# IndoorGMLEditor

IndoorGML-Editor is a desktop Java application to edit and modify gml files based on the IndoorGMl schema. With this app you can import
a gml file and represent it in 2D. You can create, modify or delete a cellspace and after then, you can export it to gml again.
Unfortunately the application doesn't cover every part of the indoorGML schema. The example file is in the resource folder called
"ISS1stFloor.xml". It works with similar structured files as "ISS1stFloor.xml".

Requirements:
-Java 8
-Java IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse or other)
-Maven

1. Download the source code form GitHub 
2. Import it to a Maven project using IntelliJ, Eclipse or other IDE
   If you are using IntelliJ, be sure to mark "src" folders as Source and "resource" folders as resource
3. The application works with Java 8, so modify the default JDK, if it is needed.
4. Run Main.java in "gui" module
